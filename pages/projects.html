            <p>Intuitive, responsive web-based node diagram creation utility. Visual nodes can be created, deleted, modified and organized, all in a minimalistic, limitless and instantly accessible canvas. No accounts or sign up is necessary; all the data persists in the browser and exports are saved on the userâ€™s computer, making for a smooth, seamless experience. I created this project to boost productivity and organization by efficiently visualizing class notes, philosophical ideas, flowcharts, project hierarchies, class diagrams and research information. It's perfect for visual learners and creators who prefer not to write and draw on paper. </p>

            <p>Web-based A* Pathfinding demonstration to generate, modify and solve mazes or other binary environments. The A* JavaScript implementation is guaranteed to find the shortest path between two points, which is incredibly valuable in numerous applications such as road navigation systems, enemy AI in video games, and of course solving mazes. I created this project to learn how to implement A* Pathfinding and to demonstrate it's effectiveness.</p>
