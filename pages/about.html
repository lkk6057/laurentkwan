            My name is Laurent. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. With two programmers as parents, I was exposed to computers and video games at a young age, and instantly became fixated on them. I wanted to make my own games at around 6th grade, which started me on a long journey of coding. I love creating things, and I see coding as a way to have absolute control over what I make. Whether it be a website, app, online video game, or virtual assistant, I completely define the rules, environment, and visuals. I find a lot of beauty in creating something that people can use and enjoy.
